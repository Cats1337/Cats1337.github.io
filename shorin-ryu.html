        There are various names for Shorin-Ryu such as Matsubayashi, Kobayashi, Shorinji, Shobayashi, and Sukunaihayashi, thought they all represent the same thing, Shorin-Ryu. Matsu means Pine, so Matsubayashi means “Pine Forest”. Shorin-Ryu is the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese word Shaolin. Lin means forest, Shaolin’s literal meaning is “Monastery in the woods of Mount Shaoshi”. Though the kanji for Shorin-Ryu is not entirely clear as to what small is describing. It could mean anything from the geographic size such as a small forest or a small group of forests, or even a large forest of small trees, or a small forest of large trees. Matsubayashi was created and used by Shōshin Nagamine, a karate master, as a way to honor “Bushi” Matsumura, it is read the same. Kobayashi is the pronunciation that Chōshin Chibana used, the difference is that the kanji used describes the size of something rather than the amount. Shorinji is used by Shūgorō Nakazato as well as the Hisataka group to tie Shorin-Ryu methods back to their Chinese origin. Shobayashi-Ryu was introduced by Chotoku Kyan, it’s not known exactly why this term was used other than it’s an older pronunciation that he may have been more familiar with. Sukunaihayashi means the same thing as Shorin-Ryu and Shaolin, the kanji is the same, just the pronunciation is different.
