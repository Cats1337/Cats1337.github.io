        I have been doing karate for over a decade now, I started in 2009 when I was about seven in first grade. My Father and Brother did karate at the time, my brother would later quit while my Father and I would continue to practice. A lot has changed since then things I had to learn in order to get my next belt is no longer required, senpais have come and gone. Though the style has stayed the same, I have learned more about karate in the past couple of years doing research projects than I had before. I myself am a Shodan, 1st-degree blackbelt. My father Is a Sandan, 3rd-degree. There is a saying that once you become a black belt, you’re still a white belt because your journey has just begun. The black belts are actually designed so that the black will eventually disappear to reveal a white belt. The whiter your black belt, the more of a master you are. My first Karate essay was written in 2014, very poorly I might say, but that was the start of my deep dive into karate. Since then my knowledge of the subject has vastly increased. I thought it was all about fighting, and like in the movies how samurais and ninjas learned karate to kill. Though that’s not at all what it’s about, yes there is fighting but the main part of the technique. One of the most memorable things that I can remember was one story Sensei would tell us about how he invited another Sensei to do a class, but his English wasn’t the best, so it consisted of “No, like this” and such the most memorable thing he said was when someone asked him what the best way to defend yourself was, and his answer was so simple that it was complex. He said, “No be there.” which in short means you don’t have to beat the person to a pulp to be safe, you can sweep them off their feet and run and that would be the best solution. Karate has become more about how to protect yourself than how to harm others.
