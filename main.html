        who is also considered another father of modern karate. Gichin Funakoshi’s family was against the banning of the topknot. On August 9, 1871, the Japanese government issued the

        , Cropped Hair Edict, which essentially banned the topknot. This also had an adverse effect and many samurai rushed to get their photos taken with the icon chonmage topknot, which boosted the popularity of the hairstyle. The Japanese government wanted to ban the topknot as people were hiding weapons in their hair. Gichin’s family was opposed to this ban. Gichin’s grades were good, he was well versed in both classical Chinese and Japanese philosophies and teachings, though he was not allowed to attend medical school since his family disagreed with the topknot ban. Gichin would instead become an assistant teacher in an Okinawan school, where he would first meet Ankō Asato through Asato’s son, and they became good friends. Asato would later become a karate and Jigen-Ryu master as well as one of Funakoshi’s first teachers, the other being Ankō Itosu. At night Gichin would travel to Asato’s house where he would learn karate. Along the line Ankō Itosu would also join in helping to teach Gichin, he would eventually become a school teacher and continue to train with both Master Itosu and Master Asato. Itosu and Asato both studied under the same master, 
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matsumura_Sōkon">Sōkon "Bushi" Matsumura </a>
        , who was given the name Bushi, meaning warrior, by the Okinawan king as a recognition of his abilities and accomplishments in martial arts. Matsumura was described by Gichin as a sensei, teacher of teachers, with a terrifying presence. Matsumura won every one of the many duels he fought. Matsumura was tall, thin, and possessed a pair of unsettling eyes, Itosu described him as being blindingly fast, and deceptively strong. Eventually, Okinawan karate emerged from its seclusion and became a legal form of martial arts. In 1922 Funakoshi and Makoto Gima were invited to the
